                Chinese checkers is a strategy board
                game of German origin which can be played by two, three, four, or six people,
                playing individually or with partners. The game is a modern and simplified variation of the game
                Halma.
                <br/>
                The objective is to be first to race all of one's pieces across the hexagram-shaped board into
                "home"— the corner of the star opposite one's starting corner—using single-step moves or moves that jump
                over other pieces. The remaining players continue the game to establish second-, third-, fourth-,
                fifth-, and last-place finishers. The rules are simple, so even young children can play.
                <br/>
                Game was implemented in Java using JavaFX framework for GUI. Every player can connect to server and
                create or join to game. Bots implemented on server side can be added to game, if amount of player is too
                small.

                Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts. It can
                also be defined as a set of activities and processes to solve problems by using or applying the
                characteristics of game elements. Gamification commonly employs game design elements to improve user
                engagement, organizational productivity, flow, learning, crowdsourcing, employee recruitment and
                evaluation, ease of use, usefulness of systems, physical exercise, traffic violations, voter apathy, and
                more. A collection of research on gamification shows that a majority of studies on gamification find it
                has positive effects on individuals. However, individual and contextual differences exist.
                <br/>
                Game was implemented in Kotlin. Players have list of all Wroclaw dwarfs, with distance to each one, and
                catch indicator for caught, uncaught and in-range dwarfs.

                Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade game created by Tomohiro
                Nishikado. It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed in the United States by the
                Midway division of Bally. Within the shooter genre, Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set
                the template for the shoot 'em up genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with
                a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.
                <br/>
                Game was implemented in Java using JavaFX framework for GUI. Only single player mode is available.

            <div class="description">
                Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practiced for a number of reasons such as
                self-defense; military and law enforcement applications; competition; physical, mental and spiritual
                development; and entertainment or the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.
                <br/>
                Although the term martial art has become associated with the fighting arts of East Asia, it originally
                referred to the combat systems of Europe as early as the 1550s. The term is derived from Latin and means
                "arts of Mars", the Roman god of war.
